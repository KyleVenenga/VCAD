VCAD is reliant on the database to work.

1. Import the database into local MySQL Server.
2. Make sure there is a user account called vcad with a password vcad123 that has permissions
3. In dbCred.py update the information to the account you want the program to have access to. 
4. root password is 'admin'
5. Make sure the server is running. (MySQLD.exe in task manager)
